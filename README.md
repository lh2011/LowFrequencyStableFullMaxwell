# LowFrequencyStableFullMaxwell

This repo contains the code for the paper "A Two-Step Formulation of Maxwellâ€™s Equations Using Generalized
Tree-Cotree Gauges for Low-Frequency-Stability". The current version is a Snapshot and a final version will be published soon.

In order to run the code, the Nurbs package, obtainable via https://octave.sourceforge.io/nurbs/, and GeoPDEs, obtainable via https://github.com/rafavzqz/geopdes, are required.
